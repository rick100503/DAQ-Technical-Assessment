# Brainstorming


I attempted to dockersie the react app, but I was unable to fix the errors within the dockerfiles and could not docker compose up and push it to docker hub. Dockerfiles may cause errors.

For the frontend, I was also planning to implement a live js chart graph of recent temperatures, but I could finish this componenet in the time allotted.
